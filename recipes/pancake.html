    <h2>Quick and easy snacks for breakfasts!</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite pancake recipe that I make for my family and friends. They are soft, fluffy, and very easy to make. The chocolate chips can be substituted with frozen blueberries that have been thawed. I sometimes double this recipe because they go quickly!</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp <em>white</em> sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter, <em>melted</em> and <em>cooled</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl</li>
            <li>Beat egg into milk in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour melted butter into flour mixture; whisk in milk mixture to make a smooth batter. Fold chocolate chips into batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a small nonstick skillet over low heat; pour about 1/3 cup of batter into hot skillet and cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Cook pancake until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes; flip pancake and cook covered until other side is browned. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
